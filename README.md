# Job Portal Demo

This project is a collaboration demonstrating features across HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP.

## What is included
- `index.html` - Home page with headings, paragraphs, semantic tags.
- `jobs.html` - Job listings table and examples of lists and GET form.
- `company.html` - iframe examples (map and profile).
- `apply.html` - Job application form (POST to process.php).
- `style.css` - External stylesheet (demonstrates selectors, units, floats, positioning).
- `script.js` - JavaScript demo: validation, cookies, arrays, Date, functions.
- `process.php` - Processes GET and POST; saves POSTed applications to `applications.csv`.
- `applications.csv` - Will be created when form is submitted.

## for php execution
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. For full PHP functionality, run on a local PHP-enabled server (e.g. XAMPP, MAMP, or `php -S localhost:8000` from the project folder).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser for static previews (forms that POST to PHP require a server).
